## tiny-test-data
Super small biological datasets designed with unit testing in mind.

UPDATE: Probably use [hts-specs](https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs/tree/master/test) test data instead?

### rationale
Tests are great to have but they are not very fun to write and coming
up with small datasets for testing, especially given the myriad of
file formats we deal with, is often super annoying.  One way to make
tests less not-fun to write is to have a handy set of tiny test data
at hand.

### contributing
If you have a nice set of tiny test data of your own please open up a
pull request.
